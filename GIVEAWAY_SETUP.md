## Installation Steps

### 1. Create Database Tables

Run the migration script to create the necessary database tables:

```bash
cd ~/Seedling
node create-giveaway-tables.js
```

This will create three tables:
- `giveaways` - Stores giveaway information
- `giveaway_entries` - Stores user entries
- `giveaway_winners` - Stores winners

### 2. Deploy Commands

The new commands need to be registered with Discord:

```bash
node deploy-commands.js
```

This will register:
- `/g-create` - Create a new giveaway
- `/g-close` - Close an active giveaway early
- `/g-reroll` - Reroll winners for a giveaway

### 3. Restart the Bot

```bash
pm2 restart seedy-discord-bot
```

## Commands

### `/g-create`
Creates a new giveaway with an interactive modal.

**Modal Fields:**
- **Giveaway Name**: The title of your giveaway (e.g., "Elite Kit Giveaway")
- **Description**: What you're giving away (e.g., "5x Elite Kits for SEED PvE Server")
- **Max Winners**: How many winners to pick (e.g., 1, 5, 10)
- **Time**: When the giveaway ends
  - `1m` = 1 minute
  - `30m` = 30 minutes
  - `1h` = 1 hour
  - `12h` = 12 hours
  - `1d` = 1 day
  - `7d` = 7 days

**What Happens:**
1. You fill out the modal
2. Bot creates a green embed in the current channel
3. Users click the üå± button to enter
4. Bot sends DM confirmation to each entrant
5. When time expires, bot picks random winners
6. Winners get DM notifications
7. Announcement posted in giveaway channel

### `/g-close <giveaway_name>`
Ends an active giveaway early.

**Usage:**
1. Type `/g-close` and start typing the giveaway name
2. Autocomplete will show active giveaways
3. Select the giveaway to close
4. Bot immediately picks winners and announces them

### `/g-reroll <giveaway_name>`
Picks new winners for an ended giveaway.

**Usage:**
1. Type `/g-reroll` and start typing the giveaway name
2. Autocomplete will show ended giveaways
3. Select the giveaway to reroll
4. Bot picks new random winners and announces them
5. New winners get DM notifications

## How It Works

### Entry Process
1. User clicks the üå± button on giveaway embed
2. Bot checks if giveaway is active
3. Bot checks if user already entered
4. Bot adds entry to database
5. Bot updates embed with new entry count
6. Bot sends confirmation DM to user:
   ```
   üéâ Successfully Entered!
   Hello {Username},
   
   You successfully entered the giveaway for {Giveaway Name}
   ```

### Winner Selection
- Uses `crypto.randomBytes()` for cryptographically secure random number generation
- Truly random and fair selection
- No duplicates - each user can only win once per giveaway
- Respects max_winners setting

### Automatic Ending
- Bot schedules timer when giveaway is created
- When time expires, bot automatically:
  1. Marks giveaway as ended
  2. Picks random winners
  3. Saves winners to database
  4. Sends DM to each winner
  5. Posts announcement in giveaway channel
  6. Updates original embed to show winners

### Bot Restart Handling
- On bot startup, loads all active giveaways
- Reschedules timers for each active giveaway
- If giveaway time has passed, ends immediately
